• Course Page: All course content will be hosted on Canvas.
This
includes homework assignments, exams, discussions, and more.
All
announcements will be made through Canvas. Additionally, uploading
work and grading will be done through Canvas. For more information,
visit https://canvas-support.emory.edu/.
• Lecture Slides: The slides are intended to be self-contained when
students take notes and complete them during lectures. It is recom-
mended to consult the referenced sources used in creating the slides
for a deeper understanding. Complete versions of the slides will not be
provided. In the event of an absence, lecture notes should be obtained
from a classmate or by consulting the references.
• Python: We will primarily code in Python in this course.
• AI Tools: Students are permitted to use AI tools to assist in generat-
ing Python and LaTeX code. However, AI-generated content must be
carefully reviewed for accuracy, as any conceptual errors in the code
will result in 0 points for that portion of the assignment. Additionally,
students must include a disclaimer statement indicating the use of AI.

• Problem Sets (30%)
Each week, you will be assigned problem sets covering a mix of numer-
ical analysis and Python implementation, either to solve at home or
during lecture hours. There will be NO late submissions allowed
for any reason. Nonetheless, to account for unforeseen circumstances
at the end of the semester, the lowest two assignment scores will be
dropped.
– Homework
You will have the freedom to choose your groups for these assign-
ments. For the first two homework assignments, you are allowed

--- Text (excluding tables) ---
to change groups if desired. However, starting from Homework 3
(including Homework 3), groups will be fixed. If you do not choose
groups, they will be assigned randomly. You will work on these
assignments in teams of 2-3 members. For group work, each team
should develop one submission, which may include solutions to
math problems, Python code, results from Python experiments,
plots, etc. A single PDF document for each group should be up-
loaded to Canvas. Make sure your submissions are typeset and
typed using LaTeX (i.e., not handwritten work embedded as an
image). Homework will be graded based on completion, accuracy,
and clarity of presentation. There will be approximately seven
homework assignments due every week, excluding exam weeks and
weeks with in-class activities. Homework is due on Thursdays
at 5:59 p.m..
– In-class Activities Throughout the semester, we will have oc-
casional in-class activities designed to deepen your understanding
of course topics through guided practice. Some of these will be
completed individually, while others will be collaborative. The ex-
pected format (individual or group) will be clearly specified each
time. Group work is only allowed with students physically present
in class that day—students not in attendance cannot participate
or contribute remotely. These activities will be open-book, and
you are welcome to ask the instructor for clarification during the
activity. A topic will be announced in advance, and you are ex-
pected to read or review the relevant material beforehand to be
prepared.
• Lab Work (10%)
Attendance at your designated lab session each week is mandatory.
Labs are designed to reinforce and extend your understanding of the
material covered in class and to help identify and correct misconcep-
tions early. Lab assignments will be graded based on completion, and
each group of 2–3 students must submit one assignment per session.
You may choose your group members each week from among the stu-
dents present, but if no group is selected, one will be assigned to you.
Only students who are physically present during the lab ses-
sion may participate and be listed on the submitted assign-

ment. If a student is absent, they may not contribute to the lab work
or receive credit for that week’s submission.
In some sessions, you may be asked to answer multiple-choice questions
instead of submitting a traditional lab report.
All lab assignments are due at the end of the lab session. There
will be no makeup lab assignments. However, to account for unforeseen
absences, the lowest three lab grades will be dropped. This policy is
meant to accommodate unavoidable absences while encouraging con-
sistent participation.
• Exams (30% + 30%)
There will be two midterm exams and a final exam. The final exam
will be cumulative with more emphasis on later material. All exams
are timed and closed-book: no notes, books, or unnecessary electronic
devices can be used.
Currently, the exams are scheduled to be in-
person. If exams must be given remotely, more details will be provided.
Makeup midterms and final exams will be given only in extreme situ-
ations. You must notify the instructor at least two weeks before the
midterm if you have a conflict or have a valid excuse verified by the
Oﬀice of Undergraduate Education (OUE).

COURSE POLICIES
Expectations Students are expected to participate actively during lectures
and lab sessions, engaging with the material, asking questions, and con-
tributing to discussions.
In addition, you should learn from independent
work, particularly from reading the textbook. Although all topics will be
covered in class, it is not possible to cover them in the same detail as the
textbook.
Communication
Canvas is the preferred way of communication for this course.
Relevant
course announcements and material will be shared through Canvas. Stu-
dents should subscribe to those announcements. Students are encouraged
to pose general questions on the Ask the Professor and other discussion
boards. This policy aims at reducing response times (since other students
can reply, too), and answers are useful to other students. Personal ques-
tions/comments/concerns should be emailed to the instructor and will be
answered within one business day (if not, please assume your initial email
was not received and send a follow-up).
Academic Integrity
The Honor Code is in effect throughout the semester. By taking this course,
you aﬀirm that it is a violation of the code to cheat on exams, to plagia-
rize, to deviate from the teacher’s instructions about collaboration on work
that is submitted for grades, to give false information to a faculty member,
and to undertake any other form of academic misconduct. You agree that
the instructor is entitled to move you to another seat during examinations,
without explanation. You also aﬀirm that if you witness others violating the
code you have a duty to report them to the honor council.
Academic Integrity & Copyrights
Direct copying of solutions or parts of solutions from any source is a violation
of the honor code, as is sharing your solutions with others. All exams are to
be done without any assistance from anyone else. Your work is at all times
governed by Emory’s Undergraduate Honor System. Failure to follow these
restrictions and giving or receiving unauthorized aid or assistance on any
course assignment are Emory University Honor System violations. If you are
unsure what online resources you are permitted to use, ask your instructor.
