app/_layout.tsx

What it does:

Defines the global layout for the app using expo-router.

Wraps the entire app in AssignmentsProvider so all screens can access shared assignment data.

Renders the bottom navigation bar (Home, Classes, Calendar, Profile) plus the floating + button.

Hides the bottom nav and plus menu on the login and signup routes, so those screens are full-screen.


components/AssignmentsContext.tsx

What it does:

Creates a React context to store all assignments for the current user.

Exposes a useAssignments() hook that screens/components can call to read/write assignment data.

Provides helper functions for:

Normalizing dates to ISO format (safeISO)

Checking if a date is today, overdue, or within 7 days

Assigning a priority (high, medium, low) based on due date

AssignmentsProvider wraps the app and manages the list of assignments in state and a helper to add assignments from parsed drafts.


components/PlusMenu.tsx

What it does:

UI for the floating + menu that slides up when the center button is pressed.

Shows actions like Upload Syllabus, Add Class, and Add Assignment.

When Upload Syllabus is chosen, opens the upload flow modal where the user can paste text or upload PDFs/images (and optionally enable AI repair).


components/UploadSyllabusModal.tsx (if you kept it separate)

What it does:

Full-screen or sheet-style modal that appears when the user chooses Upload Syllabus from the plus menu.

Contains:

AI toggle (decides whether to call the LLM repair on the backend)

Input for course name

Text area for pasting raw syllabus text

Buttons to Upload PDF and Upload Image

Handles calling the backend endpoints:

POST /assignments/pdf for PDFs

POST /assignments/image for images (OCR)

POST /assignments/text for pasted text

Receives parsed assignments, turns them into drafts, and passes them into the context via addAssignmentsFromDrafts.


components/CalendarView.tsx (if present)

What it does:

Renders the calendar UI with Month / Week / Day toggle chips.

Shows a month grid similar to a standard calendar, highlighting days that have assignments.

When a date is selected, shows the list of assignments due that day (with course and type).

Used by the app/calendar.tsx screen.


components/ClassList.tsx (if present)

What it does:

Shows a scrollable list of “folder card” rectangles, one per class.

Each card displays:

Class name

Count of Overdue and Upcoming assignments for that class

When a class is pressed, opens a view of all assignments for that specific class (overdue + upcoming).

app/index.tsx (current “Home” or redirect)

Depending on your latest setup, this does one of two things:

If it’s your Home screen:

Displays:

“Welcome” header

Stats for Upcoming (Next 7 Days) and Overdue

Section for Today’s Assignments, filterable by class

Reads assignments from AssignmentsContext to show what’s due today, what’s coming up, and what’s overdue.

If you changed it to a redirect:

Immediately redirects the root / route to /login so the login screen appears first.


app/home.tsx (if you moved Home here)

What it does:

Main dashboard screen for the user after they log in.

Shows:

Quick stats (upcoming vs overdue)

Today’s assignments (filterable by class)

Shortcut sections to classes and calendar views

Acts as the main landing page after the login/directions flow.


app/classes.tsx

What it does:

Screen that lists all classes the user has assignments for.

Renders large full-width “folder” cards, each representing a class.

When a class card is tapped, shows all assignments related to that class (including overdue and upcoming).


app/calendar.tsx

What it does:

Screen used to display the assignments in a calendar layout.

Uses the calendar view component (if separated) to show Month / Week / Day views.

Lets the user tap on a date to see all assignments due on that date.


app/profile.tsx

What it does:

Screen for basic user profile UI (purely frontend for now).

Lets the user edit:

Name

Email

Password (just a placeholder until real auth is connected)

Shows a circular initials avatar generated from the user’s name.

For now, clicking Save just shows a stub alert; it’s meant to be wired to Supabase later.


app/login.tsx

What it does:

Login screen UI for email + password (no real auth yet).

Includes:

Email input

Password input

“Log in” button

Link to go to the Sign up screen

When the user taps Log in and passes basic validation, it:

Shows a small “how to use the app” popup/guide

After the user dismisses the guide, navigates to the main Home screen (e.g., /home or / depending on your setup).


app/signup.tsx

What it does:

Similar to login.tsx but for creating a new account UI (frontend only for now).

Collects name, email, and password fields.

On Sign Up, it also shows the short “how to use the app” popup/directions.

After the guide is dismissed, it routes the user into the main app (Home screen).
